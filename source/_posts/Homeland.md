Carrie,
I guess I’m done, and we never happened.  
I’m not one for words, but they’re coming now.  
I don’t believe in fate or destiny or horoscopes, but I can’t say I’m surprised things turned out this way. I always felt there was something kind of pulling me back to darkness. Does that make sense?  
But I wasn’t allowed a real life or real love. That was for normal people. With you, I thought, ah, maybe, just maybe, but I know now that was a false glimmer.  
I’m used to those-they happen all the time in the desert-but this one got to me. And here’s the thing, this death, this end of me is exactly what should have happened. I wanted the darkness. I fucking asked for it. It has me now.  
So don’t put a star on the wall for me. Don’t say some dumb speech. Just think of me as a light on the headlands, a beacon, steering you clear of the rocks.  
I loved you.  
Yours for always now.  
-Quinn


我不是一个善言辞的人，但是现在很多话涌上心头。
请不要在墙上为我挂勋章，不要说一些没用的话，仅仅把我当做海角上的一道光，一座灯塔，指引你避开礁石。
